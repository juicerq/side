# Side, an appointment project

## Project Idea:
  Users can choose a day and hour to make an appointment and It will send a email to all Admin Users.
  Admins can fully customize which day and hour are available for users to choose. They can see a list of all schedules, create manually a new one and update one's made by users (users will be notified)

## Objective with the Project
  I started this project because I wanted to fully create and deploy a full-stack web where all comes from me. This way I can refine my basics, learn new things and develop my process of thought
