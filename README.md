## Project Idea:
  - Users can choose a day and hour to make an appointment and It will send a email to all Admin Users.

  - Admins can fully customize which day and hour are available for users to choose. They can see a list of all schedules, create manually a new one and update one's made by users (users will be notified).

## Objective
  I started this project because I wanted to fully create and deploy a full-stack web where all comes from me. This way I can refine my basics, learn new things and develop my process of thought.

## About
  - Tecnologies: NextJS, Typescript, TailwindCSS and tRPC. I used JWT for all the user logic and Zod for validations.

  - Deploy: deployed the project using Vercel and Supabase.

  - ORM: I chose Drizzle with PostgreSQL because I was curious of using something that isn't Prisma and because it is closer to pure SQL than Prisma.
